# 3. Basic Usage

Use `cd` normally a few times to visit your project folders so Zoxide can "learn" them. After that, you can use `z`.

## Jump to a Folder
Instead of `cd`, just type `z` and part of the folder name:

```bash
z rag
```
(This instantly jumps to your `/Users/myuser/RAGprojects/rag-notes` folder).

## Interactive Search
If you forgot the exact name or want to see a list of matches:

1. Type `z <keyword>` and press the **Tab** key `⇥` (e.g., `z proj<Tab>`).
2. Use the arrow keys `↓` `↑` to select the right folder.
3. Press `Enter`.
