# 1. Setup ⌘ + G Shortcut

This guide configures a custom keyboard shortcut (`⌘ + G`) on macOS to instantly open the Terminal in whatever folder you have selected in Finder.

## Enable the Service

1. Open macOS **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Keyboard** on the left menu.
3. Click the **Keyboard Shortcuts...** button on the right.
4. Select **Services** on the left menu.
5. Expand the **Files and Folders** section.
6. Check the box next to **New Terminal at Folder**.

## Set the Shortcut

1. In that same window, double-click the word "none" (or the existing shortcut) on the right side of the **New Terminal at Folder** row.
2. Press **`⌘ + G`** on your keyboard to record the new shortcut.
3. Click **Done**.

Now, when you select any folder in Finder, you can press `⌘ + G` to instantly open a Terminal window at that exact location.
